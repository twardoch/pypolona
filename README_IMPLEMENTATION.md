# PyPolona Git-Tag-Based Semversioning Implementation

## Overview

This implementation adds comprehensive git-tag-based semversioning, testing, and CI/CD automation to the PyPolona project.

## ‚úÖ What Has Been Implemented

### 1. Git-Tag-Based Semversioning System
- **Version Management**: Configured `hatch-vcs` for automatic version detection from git tags
- **Semantic Versioning**: Uses proper semver format (e.g., `v1.0.0`, `v1.1.0`, `v2.0.0`)
- **Fallback Version**: Graceful handling when no tags are present
- **Dynamic Versioning**: Version automatically determined from git tags at build time

### 2. Comprehensive Test Suite
- **Test Framework**: Complete pytest-based test suite with coverage reporting
- **Test Categories**:
  - `tests/test_version.py` - Version format validation and detection
  - `tests/test_cli.py` - Command-line interface argument parsing
  - `tests/test_polona_api.py` - Core API functionality and data models
- **Coverage**: Configured with pytest-cov for test coverage reporting
- **Type Checking**: MyPy integration for static type analysis

### 3. Local Build and Release Scripts
- **`scripts/build.sh`**: Environment setup and dependency installation
- **`scripts/test.sh`**: Complete test suite execution with linting and type checking
- **`scripts/release.sh`**: Automated release creation with version validation
- **`scripts/demo.sh`**: Demonstration of the complete workflow

### 4. GitHub Actions CI/CD Pipeline
- **Multi-Python Testing**: Automated testing on Python 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12
- **Quality Gates**: Linting with Ruff, type checking with MyPy
- **Multiplatform Builds**: Linux, macOS, and Windows binary creation
- **Automated Publishing**: PyPI package publishing on git tags
- **Release Automation**: GitHub releases with downloadable artifacts

### 5. Multiplatform Release Builds
- **PyInstaller Integration**: Standalone executable creation
- **Platform-Specific Packaging**:
  - Linux: `.tar.gz` archives
  - macOS: `.dmg` disk images with app bundles
  - Windows: `.zip` archives with executables
- **Artifact Management**: Automated artifact upload and retention

### 6. Easy Installation and Distribution
- **PyPI Publishing**: Automatic package publishing to PyPI
- **Binary Artifacts**: Pre-built binaries for immediate use
- **GitHub Releases**: Organized releases with comprehensive release notes
- **Installation Options**: Multiple installation methods (pip, binary downloads)

## üöÄ Usage Instructions

### Local Development

1. **Set up development environment:**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/build.sh
   ```

2. **Run tests:**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/test.sh
   ```

3. **Create a new release:**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/release.sh 1.1.0
   ```

### Release Process

1. **Version Tagging**: Create and push a git tag (e.g., `v1.1.0`)
2. **Automated CI/CD**: GitHub Actions automatically:
   - Runs full test suite
   - Builds multiplatform binaries
   - Publishes to PyPI
   - Creates GitHub release
   - Attaches downloadable artifacts

### Installation Methods

**From PyPI:**
```bash
pip install pypolona
```

**From Binary Release:**
- Download from GitHub releases page
- Extract and run the appropriate binary for your platform

## üìã Technical Details

### Version Management
- Uses `hatch-vcs` for git-tag-based versioning
- Follows semantic versioning (semver) specification
- Automatic version detection from git tags
- Fallback to `0.0.0` for development builds

### Testing Infrastructure
- **pytest**: Primary testing framework
- **pytest-cov**: Coverage reporting
- **ruff**: Code linting and formatting
- **mypy**: Static type checking
- **Coverage Target**: Configured for comprehensive coverage reporting

### CI/CD Pipeline
- **Trigger**: Activated on git tag pushes (`v*`)
- **Matrix Testing**: Python 3.9-3.12 across multiple platforms
- **Quality Gates**: All tests, linting, and type checking must pass
- **Artifact Creation**: Automated binary builds for distribution
- **Publication**: Automatic PyPI publishing with trusted publishing

### Binary Distribution
- **PyInstaller**: Creates standalone executables
- **Platform Packaging**: Native packaging for each platform
- **Dependency Bundling**: All dependencies included in binaries
- **Icon Integration**: Proper application icons for each platform

## üîß Configuration Files

### Project Configuration
- `pyproject.toml`: Main project configuration with hatch-vcs setup
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: Complete CI/CD pipeline configuration
- `scripts/`: Directory containing all build and release scripts

### Build Configuration
- PyInstaller specs dynamically generated for each platform
- Platform-specific build steps in GitHub Actions
- Dependency management through pyproject.toml

## üéØ Benefits

1. **Automated Release Process**: No manual version management needed
2. **Quality Assurance**: Comprehensive testing on multiple Python versions
3. **Multiplatform Support**: Binaries available for all major platforms
4. **Easy Distribution**: Multiple installation methods for different use cases
5. **Professional Workflow**: Industry-standard CI/CD practices
6. **Maintenance Friendly**: Standardized scripts and clear documentation
