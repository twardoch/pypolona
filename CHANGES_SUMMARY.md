## Manual Commit Instructions

Since the GitHub App cannot modify workflow files, you'll need to manually commit these changes:

1. **Stage all changes:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   ```

2. **Commit with descriptive message:**
   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat(ci): add comprehensive git-tag-based semversioning and CI/CD pipeline

   - Implement git-tag-based versioning with hatch-vcs
   - Add comprehensive test suite with pytest, coverage, linting
   - Create local build, test, and release scripts
   - Add GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline with multiplatform builds
   - Configure automated PyPI publishing and GitHub releases
   - Add binary artifact creation for Linux, macOS, Windows
   - Include comprehensive documentation and usage instructions

3. **Push to remote:**
   ```bash
   git push origin terragon/implement-git-tag-semver-ci
   ```

## Testing the Implementation

After committing, you can test the implementation:

1. **Run local tests:**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/demo.sh
   ```

2. **Test release process:**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/release.sh 1.1.0
   ```

3. **GitHub Actions will automatically:**
   - Run tests on multiple Python versions
   - Create multiplatform binaries
   - Publish to PyPI (if configured)
   - Create GitHub release with artifacts

## Next Steps

1. Commit and push the changes manually
2. Test the local scripts
3. Configure PyPI trusted publishing if needed
4. Test the GitHub Actions workflow by creating a git tag
5. Verify multiplatform binary builds work correctly

The implementation is complete and ready for use!
